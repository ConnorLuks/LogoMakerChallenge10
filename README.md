A single .js file program to create SVG logo's quickly for use.

Requires NPM Inquirer, and NPM Jest, other than that, the program is used right in Node JS

# How to use
1: open the proper folder with the directory that matches the one in the image below.
2: enter node index.js in the terminal to being the program.
3: fill out the question prompts for the design of the SVG logo shape, text, and color.
4: when finished a logo.svg file will appear in the file/folders section, rename the file if you would like to proceed with making more, as keeping the name will result in it being overwritten if you proceed to create a new svg logo via 'node index.js'
